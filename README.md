# Tebigep-app
This is the app that we developed for the winter camp for AALTebigep Club . Basically, it is used for the Uni Entrance Exam (YKS). You can use it to calculate your score, save them to database and compare them with your previous exams.


Info for the app:
- We designed the interface with QtDesigner and then compiled it.
- The stopwatch is taken from GeeksForGeeks: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/pyqt5-digital-stopwatch/
